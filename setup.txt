To insure we all have the same packages, create a virtual enviornment inside of the Bitcamp2022 directory with the following command

mkdir venv
cd venv
python3 -m venv .

From there, activate the virtual enviornment (While in the venv directory) with this command

source bin/activate

Afterward, go back to the main Bitcamp file. There you will find a requirements.txt file. Perform the following command

pip install -r requirements.txt


This will ensure we all have the same packages and versions moving forward
